- Updated gitpod.yml file to enable automatic install of AWS for everytime I start the workspace.

- Created an AWS budget with AWS CLI (Added the AWS folder that has the budget.json file)

- Had some challenges creating a budget via Gitpod so I used the terminal of my local machine. Created an AWS folder on my local machine, created the budget and notification.json files. Then ran:

```
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id my_account_id \
    --budget file://budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://notifications-with-subscribers.json

```

### To store AWS credentials permanently, I used

        gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="Insert Here"
        gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="Insert Here"
        gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="Insert Here"
